# **DISCLAIMER**

This software records audio, converts it to text in real time, and may use third-party AI systems to generate transcripts, summaries, or other derived content. **No raw audio is persisted, stored, or retained by this software unless a host explicitly modifies it to do so.** Only the transcribed text is produced and passed through the system.

By using, hosting, or deploying this software, you accept full responsibility for all data handling, disclosure, and legal compliance.

## **Host Responsibility**

Anyone hosting or operating this software **must be fully transparent with their users** about:

- What audio is being captured
- That raw audio is not stored by default
- Whether the host has modified the software to retain audio or logs
- How long transcripts or summaries are stored
- Where data is stored
- Whether AI models or external APIs process the text
- Who has access to generated transcripts or summaries
- Any logging, monitoring, retention, or analysis practices
- Any risks associated with voice processing and AI inference

The authors of this software **do not and cannot enforce** the host’s deployment or data-handling choices.
**All privacy notices, consent mechanisms, and compliance obligations fall entirely on the host.**

## **No Warranty**

This software is provided **“AS IS”**, without any warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to correctness, security, accuracy, reliability, or fitness for any purpose.

## **No Liability**

Under **no circumstances** shall the authors or contributors be liable for any:

- misuse
- data leaks
- privacy violations
- security failures
- compliance issues
- AI output errors
- deployment misconfiguration
- host-made modifications that store or process audio differently
- damages related to recordings, transcripts, summaries, or model outputs

**If you deploy it, you own the risks.**

## **Use at Your Own Risk**

By using this software, you agree that **all responsibility lies with the host**, not the authors.
